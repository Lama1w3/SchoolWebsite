            <p >
              <b><span class="greetings">Greetings to one and all!</span></b><br>
Welcome to G.B. Pant Memorial Government College, Rampur Bushahr. I am glad that you have chosen to be a part of this family to pursue your academic journey. Since our inception in 1959, the college has grown in stature and added feathers every year in the field of academics, sports, cultural exploration and extra-curricular activities. We, at Government College, Rampur Bushahr, believe that honesty and excellence in education is vital for the holistic growth of the society and our college motto 'सा विद्या या विमुक्तये' further concretizes our belief that only knowledge can provide complete liberation to a human mind and enrich the personality with critical thinking, harmony and positive attitude.
In the last few years, Corona virus wreaked havoc on humanity and the threat on life posed by this virus was immense. All forms of life struggled and professional work was hampered due to the spread of this contagious virus. We, at the college, accepted this challenge and our journey towards the attainment of excellence even during the times of the pandemic continued. We successfully conducted the admission process and took quality classes online and tackled the menace of the pandemic with high spirits.
The strength of our institution lies in its values. Our values are the backbone of the institution. We envision ourselves as the builders of the nation. Among many values there are two that are dear to the institution. First, the college caters to multi-cultural students of Kullu, Kinnaur, Shimla and Mandi and being an institution of high principles and values, we believe in quality education and cultural inclusiveness. Therefore, the college becomes a distinctive space for the interaction of these age-old cultures. Building from the first point, at Government college, Rampur Bushahr, we see our diversity amongst our students as our strength. Thus, the message we pass on to the students covers large percentage of the areas of the state.
We understand our large strength of students and thus, we stress upon the positive interaction of humans with nature. Our rigorous effort to inculcate the value of sustainable development and ecological awareness within and outside the campus through community outreach programmes is evident through our ‘Green Campus Initiative’ and college volunteer groups (NCC, NSS, Rovers and Rangers, Energy Club, Eco Club and SOCH Literary Society). These diverse set of meaningful practices makes us realize our significant role in building future citizens and leaders of the country.
During your time at the college, we will provide ample opportunities to learn and grow intellectually and spiritually. We have a well-structured academic environment and life altering extra- curricular activities that are guided and mentored by our dedicated faculty and supporting staff. I hope this meaningful interaction will encourage you to generate new ideas, increase knowledge and enhance your skills that are required in today’s fast changing world. I welcome you all to the Government College, Rampur Bushahr, and by selecting this college you have chosen an institution that is equipped with digital smart classrooms, library, lush green campus, a big playground, well equipped laboratories, a sizeable auditorium, a conference room, and a canteen. This is only the beginning of our long and fruitful intellectual journey.
